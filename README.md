# MNIST: 99.4

The repository contains two different exercises. One, where we trained a Model with an Excel Sheet. The goal was to build functions that performed Feed Forward and Back Propagation based on a simple Neural Network architecture. More details on how we performed all the activities with respect to training a model on excel is available in this [link](train_nn_excel/README.md). The other where we trained a model on MNIST data. We trained a total of **60** neural networks having the goal to understand how each concept that we know affect during the training of a neural network. More details of this is available in this [link](MNIST_99_4/README.md).
